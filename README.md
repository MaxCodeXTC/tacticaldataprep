# Tactical Data Preparation

![](assets/eda.jpeg)

## Executive Summary
Tactical data science zooms in on the mental models behind common data preparation tasks, and aim to equip beginning practitioners with some practical advice on wrangling data in a productive manner. The 6 main takeaways are illustrated in both R and Python code, using a real world dataset. 

1. Favor a problem-solving style that is efficient and yields a **short feedback cycle**  
2. **Isolate contexts** by diagnosing your data before exploring it  
3. **Diagnostic questions** are sanity checks. They asks: "does the state of data conform to my expectations and statistical reality?"  
4. **Exploratory questions** are concerned with pattern discovery. They asks: "how can the information in the data be applied?"  
5. Incorporate **prior knowkedge** and **domain knowledge** in your data preparation tasks  
6. Preserve an **unmodified copy of the data** and understand that **every language behave differently** and yield different results even if they look semantically similar   

All example code are provided in R and Python, but only basic familiarity in both language is assumed.
